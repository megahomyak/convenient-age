This is a small utility to easily encrypt or decrypt messages through AGE (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) without storing the personal private key unencrypted

Requires "$CONVENIENT_AGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY" to be set (the directory where the sender's private and public key and the recipients' public keys will be stored)

Commands supported:
./convenience.sh setup -- get the personal keys and store them, encrypting the private key
./convenience.sh enc $RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE_NAME -- open an $EDITOR to gather and encrypt an outgoing message (recipient key taken from "$CONVENIENT_AGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY/recipients/$RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE_NAME")
./convenience.sh dec -- open an $EDITOR to gather and decrypt an incoming message
./convenience.sh add $RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE_NAME $RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY -- create the specified recipient public key file with the specified contents
./convenience.sh list -- list all the previously added recipients
./convenience.sh me -- show the sender's public key
./convenience.sh rm $RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE_NAME -- remove the specified recipient public key file
