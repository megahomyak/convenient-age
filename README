This is a small utility to easily encrypt or decrypt messages through AGE (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) without storing the personal private key unencrypted

Requires "$CONVENIENT_AGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY" to be set (the directory where the personal keys and the recipients' public keys will be stored)

Commands supported:
./convenience.sh gen -- generate personal keys (public and private), encrypting the private key
./convenience.sh enc $RECIPIENT_KEY_NAME -- open an $EDITOR to gather and encrypt an outgoing message (recipient key taken from file "$CONVENIENT_AGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY/recipients/$RECIPIENT_KEY_NAME")
./convenience.sh dec -- open an $EDITOR to gather and decrypt an incoming message
